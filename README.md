# Welcome to my script, AegisLite.

### What is Aegis?
Aegis is my current project, a roblox script, with an amazing UI and multiple ClientSided and FilteringEnabled Scripts. 

## Script:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sypcerr/Aegis/refs/heads/main/script'),true))()
```
# Aegis+ - Version 0.9.0

## New Features:
- **UI Persistence:** UI stays on the last page after resetting or dying.
- **Settings Tab:** Added a new settings menu.
- **Rescale UI Dragger:** Rescale UI with a draggable element.
- **UI Transparency Slider:** Adjust transparency in settings.
- **Smooth Drag Speed Adjusted:** Slightly faster feel for smooth drag.
- **Fly/ Fling Fixes:** Fling disables after death, fly now requires button click.

## Changes:
- Removed "Beta" from the top-right title.
- Removed PageSwitch Animation for faster feel.


## Outro:
I started working on Aegis on 05.03.2025, have been working nonstop everyday . I am still learning and trying to become better, so no criticism would be appreciated, while I am happy for bug-reports.
