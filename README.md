# Welcome to my script, AegisLite.

### What is Aegis?
Aegis is my current project, a roblox script, with an amazing UI and multiple ClientSided and FilteringEnabled Scripts. 

## Script:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sypcerr/Aegis/refs/heads/main/script'),true))()
```
# Aegis+ - Version 0.9.1

**Version 0.9.1 – Update Notes**  

- **Added:** Fully FE-compatible flips, including backflips, frontflips, and air jumps.  
- **Fixed:** Respawn UI now correctly resets all elements after dying, ensuring proper functionality.  
- **Fixed:** Flight mechanics—no more falling through the ground after activating twice, and spinning upon deactivation has been eliminated.  
- **Updated:** Resize icon redesigned for improved clarity.  
- **Fixed:** Various text corrections for the resize feature.  


## Changes:

## Outro:
I started working on Aegis on 05.03.2025, have been working nonstop everyday . I am still learning and trying to become better, so no criticism would be appreciated, while I am happy for bug-reports.
