# Welcome to my script, Aegis.

### What is Aegis?
Aegis is my current project, a roblox script, with an amazing UI and multiple ClientSided and FilteringEnabled Scripts. 

## Script:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sypcerr/Aegis/refs/heads/main/script'),true))()
```

## Features: 
### Appealing UI
Aegis uses a transparent look, to keep a smooth Overlay while having high quality scripts.
Currently, Aegis has 20 Themes, more added in future updates.  
You would catch me using a skidded template, everything you see is created by me.

### Lag free Experience:
With lots of optimization, Aegis has a fast navigation while adding smooth animations.

### Cool Scripts, more added every week:
Creating safe scripts has become harder and harder with the release of Byfron.  
To ensure the best experience, I always make sure, that the scripts are completely working, and  Bug Free. (However, if you find any, message me on Discord.)

## Outro:
I started working on Aegis on 05.03.2025, have been working nonstop everyday . I am still learning and trying to become better, so no criticism would be appreciated, while I am happy for bug-reports. 

Aegis is completely free, if you want to get Aegis+ with more features and even more themes, i'll be working on it. Stay tuned!
