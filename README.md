# Welcome to my script, Aegis.

### What is Aegis?
Aegis is my current project, a roblox script, with an amazing UI and multiple ClientSided and FilteringEnabled Scripts. 

## Script:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sypcerr/Aegis/refs/heads/main/script'),true))()
```
## Version 0.9.0 Update (important)

### Why Two Versions?

In this update, there are two versions of the script: **AegisLite** and **Aegis+**. Both versions now come with the new **Settings Tab**, but **Aegis+** includes extra features and **Beta Updates** for users who want access to the latest improvements.

### Whatâ€™s the Difference?

- **AegisLite:**
  - A lightweight version of the script with the core features.
  - Includes the new **Settings Tab** for easy customization.

- **Aegis+:**
  - A more customizable version of **AegisLite**.
  - Includes everything from **AegisLite**, along with **Beta Updates** and additional features.
  - Features such as **UI Transparency Slider** and **Rescale UI Dragger**.
  - Access to experimental and in-progress updates before they are fully released.

### Where to Get Them?

- **AegisLite**: Available in the [AegisLite repository](link-to-aegislite-repo).
- **Aegis+**: Available in the [Aegis+ repository](link-to-aegisplus-repo).

### Change Log for Version 0.9.0:
- Both versions now include a **new Settings Tab** for more configuration options.
- **Aegis+** also includes **Beta Updates** with new features like the **UI Transparency Slider** and **Rescale UI Dragger**.
- Fixed issues with **Fling** and **Fly** functionalities.
- UI now stays persistent even after resetting or dying.
