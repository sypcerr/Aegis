(Current latest Version: 0.9.0 BETA) - please scroll down for important news
# Welcome to my script, Aegis.

### What is Aegis?
Aegis is my current project, a roblox script, with an amazing UI and multiple ClientSided and FilteringEnabled Scripts. 

## Script:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sypcerr/Aegis/refs/heads/main/script'),true))()
```
## Version 0.9.0 Update

## Features: 
### Appealing UI
Aegis uses a transparent look, to keep a smooth Overlay while having high quality scripts.
Currently, Aegis has 20 Themes, more added in future updates.  
You would catch me using a skidded template, everything you see is created by me.

### Lag free Experience:
With lots of optimization, Aegis has a fast navigation while adding smooth animations.

### Cool Scripts, more added every week:
Creating safe scripts has become harder and harder with the release of Byfron.  
To ensure the best experience, I always make sure, that the scripts are completely working, and  Bug Free. (However, if you find any, message me on Discord.)

## Outro:
I started working on Aegis on 05.03.2025, have been working nonstop everyday . I am still learning and trying to become better, so no criticism would be appreciated, while I am happy for bug-reports. 

## Version 0.9.0 Update

### Why Two Versions?

In this update, I’ve introduced two versions of the UI script: **AegisLite** and **Aegis+**. Both versions provide core features, but Aegis+ offers additional customizability and extra features for users who need more advanced functionality.

### What’s the Difference?

- **AegisLite:**
  - A simpler, lightweight version of the script with all the essential features.
  - Perfect for users who want the core experience without extra options.
  
- **Aegis+:**
  - A more customizable version of **AegisLite**, offering additional settings and extra functionality.
  - Includes features like the **Rescale UI Dragger** and **UI Transparency Slider**, as well as a **new Settings Tab**.

### Where to Get Them?

- **AegisLite**: Script is pasted above
- **Aegis+**: Available in my Discord Server

Choose the version that best suits your needs based on the level of customization and features you want. Both are fully functional and provide a great experience!

### Change Log for Version 0.9.0:
- Fixed Fling and Fly functionalities, improving UI persistence.
- Added a new Settings Tab for enhanced configuration options.
- Aegis+: Added **UI Transparency Slider** and **Rescale UI Dragger** for better UI management.
